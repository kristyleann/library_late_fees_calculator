This is just a silly little project I made to see if I could make a calculator that tells you how much you owe in late fees at the Princeton Public Library (the one in Princeton, WV...not New Jersey). 

DISCLAIMER: This project is in no way affiliated with Princeton Public Library. It just happens to be my local library and I wanted to see if I could make this project.

It's specific to that library but you could use the code and change the variables to fit your local library (or any place that charges late fees on things). 

It does have it's limitations though. As of right now you can only put in info for one set of best seller books, regular books, and DVDs (as these all have different late fees associated with them). I need to fix it so you can choose to add other items in that may have been checked out on different days. For instance, 3 DVDs that have been overdue for 3 days and 2 DVDs that have been overdue for 7 days...and so on.

If you find it useful or even just amusing feel free to use it for whatever you want.
